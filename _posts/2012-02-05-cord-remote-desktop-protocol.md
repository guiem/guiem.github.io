**Motivation**: I need to connect to from my Mac to a remote desktop which is running a Windows server. I want a tool to be able to do this connection by using [RDP](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol) (Remote Desktop Protocol).  
**Solution**: I found this software, [CoRD](http://cord.sourceforge.net/index.html), which works better than the Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection for Mac (haven’t tried any others).  
**Issues**: I cannot use the local key ‘Alt’, I still have to figure it out!  
**\[SOLVED\]**: How silly am I?! Everything works so smooth… What happened is that I’m so used to press on my left ‘Alt’ key (this one doesn’t work once you’re in Windows) but the equivalent in the right hand side words perfectly.
