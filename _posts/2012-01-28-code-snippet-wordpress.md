`<span style="color: #000000;">Note: this post is deprecated, I moved to another plugin, see <a href="http://guiem.info/code-snippet-second-part-wordpress/" title="Code Snippet (second part) – WordPress">this new post</a>.</span>`

**Motivation**: I want to publish code into my posts. I’m not really motivated to search or code anything so I’ll go for a plugin this time.

**Solution**: I found [this plugin](http://www.allancollins.net/486/wordpress-code-snippet-2-0/) called “WordPress Code Snippet” which for me it’s okay. Maybe in the future I’ll search for another solution but right now it does the trick.
