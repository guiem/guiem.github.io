A little ‘siesta’ in the bus.  
Missed my stop.  
“1.8 miles from home, 37 minutes walking”, Google Maps said.  
F\*\*k! Ffffuuuuuuu!  
“0 ºC”, Google Weather said.  
F\*\*k, f\*\*k, f\*ck, fuck!  
Started jogging, why not?

A car approaches me:

– Excuse me, is this the way to get to Wheatly?

– No sir, I’m afraid it’s the next one!

– You saved my day! – the guy was almost in tears (of happiness, I assume)

***Mental note***: pay attention whenever you make a mistake, you might be saving someone’s day!
