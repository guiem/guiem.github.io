**Motivation**: I didn’t like the [first code snippet](http://guiem.info/?p=248 "Code Snipped – WordPress") plugin that I used because you had to edit the code in a different place than the post edition.

**Solution**: Now I’m using the [Better WordPress Syntax Highlighter](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/better-wordpress-syntax-based-on-geshi/stats/ "Better Wordrpess Syntax Highlighter") plugin. It is very easy to use in the post edition, you only need to add a specific *&lt;pre&gt;* tag.
