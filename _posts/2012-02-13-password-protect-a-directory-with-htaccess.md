**Motivation**: protect some directories from being accessed without authorisation.  
**Solution**: using the .httaccess file. You just have to configure one and place it into the directory you want to protect. The code inside the file would look something like this:

```

AuthType Basic
AuthName "guest"
AuthUserFile "/home/user/.htpasswds/public_html/directory2storepass/passwd"
require valid-user
```

Then you have to place the password in the directory you have chosen.
