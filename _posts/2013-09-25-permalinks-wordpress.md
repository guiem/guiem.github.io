So far, I found myself trying to solve the same problem on different machines.

– [EC2 amazon Ubuntu instance](http://guiem.info/permalinks-on-wordpress-amazon-ec2/ "Permalinks on WordPress (amazon EC2)"). In this one I had to modify `http.conf`.

– [Ubuntu server 12](http://guiem.info/permalinks-on-wordpress-ubuntu/). Here I installed apache2 so the approach was a bit different.
