I’m a computer scientist and psychologist working in artificial intelligence. Over the years, I’ve built machine learning systems at scale, led data teams, and explored how technology can be aligned with human values.

I grew up in a family of farmers, learning to make cheese by age six. I loved the fields, but even then, I was more curious about the human mind. I’d idealized the notion that by building intelligence, I might come to understand it. That curiosity led me to study computer science.

After completing a master’s in AI, I began using technology to support people in need—like developing AI-assisted wheelchairs that shared control between machine and user. That work drew me deeper into psychology, and I eventually trained and graduated as a psychologist.

Since then, I’ve worked across academia and industry—building systems to predict tourist dynamics, designing tools to explore how science, technology, and society shape one another, and improving online giving. Along the way, I’ve grown increasingly focused on how we can ensure AI benefits society as it becomes more powerful.

These days, my work centers on AI safety & alignment: making sure AI systems behave in ways that are safe, honest, and grounded in human values.
