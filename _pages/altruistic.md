Money holds practical importance in life, yet I've always felt its true value emerges from how it's used to uplift others. Coming from humble beginnings, I've consistently sought ways to meaningfully contribute beyond mere financial gestures.

Early on, grateful for the education I had access to, I began sponsoring a child's schooling and development through Fundación Vicente Ferrer. At the time, it felt like the most direct way I could consistently support others facing systemic disadvantages.

Later, in response to the growing 'brain drain' from Spain, I created Tituladosporelmundo—a small initiative to connect and support skilled professionals working abroad. It offered a space for mutual help, practical advice, and shared frustration.

In 2009, after unexpectedly winning a TV in a raffle, I turned to the online community to transform this luck into collective generosity. This led to the "[700 euros initiative](https://700euros.org)," an effort driven by community collaboration to channel resources toward meaningful causes. Although the follow-up project, Melkistonon, couldn't be implemented due to a lack of regulation at the time, the experience stayed with me. 

Years later, I joined GoFundMe, a platform that had brought to life many of the ideas I'd once dreamed of, and a place where I could finally connect technology with generosity at scale.
